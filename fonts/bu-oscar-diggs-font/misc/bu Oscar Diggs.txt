bu Oscar Diggs

This font is based loosely on some penwork done by Patten Wilson quite a while ago. Not sure on the year but sometime in the beginning of the 20th Century. I had to manufacture punctuation and some characters to fill out the font.

This particular font, bu Oscar Diggs, can be used for commercial means without charge but please contact me with your intent of usage.

Also, any donations, no matter how small, for any of my fonts usage would be appreciated, and never turned away.
